# Personal-Dashboard

Create a Dashboard for Anime, Hackathons/Competitions, Owned Stocks, Courses or anything I want to keep track of the progress. Use API to fetch and update latest stock prices, IMDB of Anime, New Anime release and descriptions, new and my level songs to play on guitar (thinking of linking progress in yousician/ timbro to recommend songs i can play), Coursera/Udemy or any other subscribed sites progress. Run this project in a cloud server so as to not refresh manually and automate lots of tasks like looking for the best price to buy/sell stock at and executing the task from linked demat account.

Task is being tracked in Trello - https://trello.com/b/hrKoqK2P/personal-dashboard
